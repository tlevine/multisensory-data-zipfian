## Information overload

  Today, we produce more information than we can handle.
  To cope with this, we data scientists convert this information
  to structured data that we can make sense of in a more
  automated way.

  That helps, but now we have to deal with all of these data.
  We need new tools to help us with these data.

## Big data

  In previous classes, you've learned about tools for
  storing insane quantities of data and running calculations
  on all of the data. We need more tools like that, but
  we also need new tools for exploring and presenting data.

  A standard data visualization tool is the data table.
  At CSV Soundsystem, we prefer CSV files.
  As MySQL borat suggests, we could just make bigger tables.
  Tables are great for finding specific values,
  but it takes a long time to spot broader trends in tables.

<p class="comment">
  This is a table of complaints against New York City police officers, I think.
  It's small enough that it fits on the screen and that
  we can get the general picture that most values are, but
  this wouldn't work for larger tables.

  So we make graphs.
